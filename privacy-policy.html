              Thank you for choosing to be part of the International Conference
              on Automated Planning and Scheduling of 2021 ("ICAPS 2021", "we",
              "us", or "our"). We are committed to protecting your personal
              information and your right to privacy. If you have any questions
              or concerns about our policy or our practices with regards to your
              personal information, please contact us at

            </p>

            <p>
              When you visit our website you trust us with your personal
              information. In this privacy notice, we describe our privacy
              policy. We seek to explain to you in the clearest way possible
              what information we collect, how we use it, and what rights you
              have in relation to it. If there are any terms in this privacy
              policy that you do not agree with, please discontinue use of our
              sites and conference registration service.
            </p>

            <p>
              This privacy policy applies to all information collected through
              our websites, including our registration website, and/or any
              related services, or events (we refer to these collectively in
              this privacy policy as "site" or "sites"). Please read this
              privacy policy carefully.
            </p>

            <p><b>What information do we collect?</b></p>

            <p>
              Information you disclose to us In short: We collect personal
              information that you provide to us such as your name, address,
              contact information, dietary preferences, data security, and
              payment information.
            </p>

            <p>
              We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us
              when registering for ICAPS 2021 and at our sites. The personal
              information that we collect depends on the context of your
              interactions with us, and the choices you make and the features
              you use. The personal information we collect may include the
              following: Name and contact data. We collect your name, email
              address, postal address, phone number, emergency contact
              information, origin institution, and other similar contact data.
              Payment data. We collect data necessary to process your payment
              when you register for ICAPS 2021 or choose to stay accommodations
              administered by ICAPS 2021. Payment data may be stored by our
              payment processor and you should review their privacy policies and
              contact the payment processor directly for questions regarding
              that information. We do not have control over this data. You may
              contact us using the above email address for our payment
              processor. All personal information that you provide to us must be
              true, complete, and accurate. You must notify us of any changes to
              such personal information that may affect your registration or
              ability to attend ICAPS 2021 or stay in accommodations.
            </p>

            <p>
              Information automatically collected In short: Information such as
              your IP address, browser, and device characteristics is
              automatically collected when you visit our site.
            </p>

            <p>
              We automatically collect information when you visit, use or
              navigate the site. This information does not reveal your specific
              identity (like your name) but may include device and usage
              information, such as referring URLs, device name, country,
              location, or information about how and when you use your site and
              other technical information. This information is primarily needed
              for security and maintenance purposes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Like many conferences with registration fees or accommodation
              management, we may also collect information through cookies and
              similar technologies during registration.
            </p>

            <p><b>How do we use your information?</b></p>
            <p>
              In short: We process your information for purposes based on our
              legitimate interests (e.g., providing conference services),
              ensuring compliance with the ICAPS Code of Conduct and other
              policies, ensuring our compliance with legal obligations
              (including law enforcement), and/or other obligations with your
              consent.
            </p>

            <p>
              We use personal information collected via our site for a variety
              of purposes, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                To send information to you. We may use your personal information
                to send you important messages regarding ICAPS 2021.
              </li>
              <li>
                To respond to legal requests and prevent harm. If we receive a
                subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect data we
                hold to determine how to respond.
              </li>
              <li>
                For other conference purposes. We may use your information for
                other purposes, such as data analysis, identifying trends in
                conference attendance, determining the effectiveness of various
                conference events, evaluating our site, evaluating third-party
                servicers, or enforcing conference policies (such as the ICAPS
                Code of Conduct).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><b>Will your information be shared with anyone?</b></p>
            <p>
              In short: We will share minimal data with third-parties (such as
              caterers, or hotels) to provide conference services and fulfill
              our obligations with you.
            </p>

            <p>
              We may process or share personal information (but not payment
              information) based on the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Requests from caterers or other third-party food services that
                require your name, emergency contact information, preferences,
                and/or other information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Requests from third-parties that provide accommodations for the
                conference that require your name, address, emergency contact
                information, preferences, and/or other information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any performance of a contract we entered into with you that
                allows us to share information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Requests from law enforcement that we must respond to as
                required by law, judicial proceedings, court order (e.g., a
                subpoena), and/or regional governments.
              </li>
              <li>
                Emails of an administrative or informative nature to ICAPS
                attendees, speakers, or other participants using third-party
                email services. This may require we share certain data with them
                regarding your name, email address, institution, and/or other
                personal information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Requests from payment processors may require that we send your
                address or other personal information to them to validate or
                verify your payment.
              </li>
              <li>
                We may disclose your information when we believe it necessary to
                investigate, prevent, or take action regarding any violation of
                our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving threats to
                the safety of any person, the prevention of illegal activities,
                and/or as evidence during litigation in which ICAPS 2021 is
                involved.
              </li>
              <li>
                We may publish or display aggregate data when we find it useful
                (e.g., when collaborating with other conferences, or at an ICAPS
                council or community meeting). In those cases, we will not share
                your personal data directly, but it may be possible to identify
                certain information (e.g., an individual's stated gender or
                dietary preference) about an individual when combined with other
                data (e.g., personal knowledge).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Unless we indicate this to you in this policy or via other direct
              communication, we do not share, sell, rent, or trade your
              information to third parties for their own promotional purposes.
              We will do our best to avoid sharing data unnecessarily and will
              work to only share what is necessary to fulfill our obligations to
              you.
            </p>

            <p><b>Do we use cookies and other tracking technologies?</b></p>
            <p>
              In short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to
              collect and store your information, particularly during payment
              processes.
            </p>

            <p>
              We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web
              beacons and pixels) to access or store session information.
            </p>

            <p><b>How long do we keep your information?</b></p>
            <p>
              In short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
              fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy policy unless
              otherwise required by law.
            </p>

            <p>
              We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
              necessary to service the ICAPS 2021 attendees and allow us to
              process data for future ICAPS conferences unless a longer
              retention policy is required by law (such as for tax purposes,
              accounting, requirements from funding agencies, or other legal
              requirements). When we have an ongoing legitimate need to process
              your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize it.
              If this is not possible (for example, because your personal
              information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
              securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
              further processing until deletion is possible.
            </p>

            <p><b>How do we keep your information safe?</b></p>
            <p>
              In short: We aim to protect your personal information through a
              system of organizational and technical security measures.
            </p>

            <p>
              We have implemented appropriate organizational security measures
              designed to protect the personal information we process. However,
              please remember that we cannot guarantee that the internet itself
              is 100% secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal
              information, the transmission of personal information to and from
              our sites is at your own risk. You should only access our services
              within a secure environment.
            </p>

            <p><b>Do we collect information from minors?</b></p>
            <p>
              In short: We do not knowingly collect data from children under 18
              years of age.
            </p>

            <p>
              We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under
              18 years of age. By using the site, you represent that you are at
              least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor
              and consent to such minor dependent's use of the site. If we learn
              that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
              been collected, we will delete that data from our records.
            </p>

            <p><b>What are your privacy rights?</b></p>
            <p>
              In short: You may request to review, change, or ask us to delete
              any of your personal data at any time.
            </p>

            <p>
              If you are a resident of the European Economic Area and you
              believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information,
              you have the right to complain to your local data protection
              supervisory authority. You can find their contact details

              (<a href="mailto:icapsGZ2021@gmail.com">icapsGZ2021@gmail.com</a

              may contact us as well. Some information may be retained in our
              files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, enforce our terms
              of use or other policies, or assist with investigations.

            <p>
              <strong>Controls for do-not-track features.</strong> Most web
              browsers and some mobile systems have Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
              features or settings you can activate to signal your privacy
              preference not to have data about your online browsing activities
              monitored. No uniform technology exists for DNT. As such, we do
              not respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism for
              communicating your choice to not be tracked online.
            </p>

            <p><b>Will we update our privacy policy?</b></p>
            <p>In short: Yes, we will update this policy as necessary.</p>

            <p>
              We may update this privacy policy from time to time. The updated
              version will be indicated by the "Revised" date and the updated
              version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. We may
              notify you if we make changes we feel you need to know (e.g.,
              material changes). We encourage you to review this privacy policy
              frequently to stay informed.
