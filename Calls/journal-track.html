                  The program committee of the 31st International Conference on
                  Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) invites submissions
                  of published journal papers for the Journal Presentations
                  Track, initiated in 2014.
                  <br /><br />

                  The track is designed to provide a forum to discuss important
                  results related to automated planning and scheduling that
                  appeared recently (from January 2020 onwards) in selective
                  journals, but have not been previously presented either at
                  ICAPS or at any other major AI conference (such as IJCAI,
                  AAAI, ECAI).
                  <br /><br />

                  The goal of this track is twofold: To provide authors an
                  opportunity to present at the conference important results
                  published in journals that might otherwise not be submitted to
                  the conference due to their length and complexity. Papers that
                  differ from traditional ICAPS format and topics are welcome.
                  <br /><br />
                  To broaden the program with lines of work at the intersection
                  between planning/scheduling and related fields such as for
                  example constraint programming, operations research, control,
                  knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning,
                  multi-agent systems, robotics, transportation, computer games,
                  and cognitive science. Papers that use planning and scheduling
                  in some innovative way (even if they do not advance the
                  planning technology itself) are welcome.
                  <br /><br />

                  <h4>Paper Presentation</h4>

                  All accepted journal presentations will be presented orally
                  during the conference – at least one author is expected to
                  register to ICAPS 2021 and to present the paper online.
                  Complete citations, abstracts and URLs of the original journal
                  papers (if available from the publisher) will be published on
                  the ICAPS 2021 web site as a permanent reference.
                  <br /><br />

                  <h4>Submission Requirements</h4>

                  Journal track submissions must meet the following criteria:
                  <br /><br />
                  Candidate papers must be published in a journal such as (but
                  not limited to) AIJ, JAIR, EJOR, AURO, JAAMAS, KER and other
                  leading journals relevant to each research area from January
                  2020 until the submission deadline. Papers that are in press
                  may be submitted as long as the final camera-ready version is
                  available. Extensions of papers that have been previously
                  presented at ICAPS or another major AI conference (such as
                  IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI) may be submitted to this track. However,
                  submissions will be reviewed upon the strength of the new
                  content.
                  <br /><br />
                  <h4>Submission Process</h4>

                  All submissions will be done via EasyChair using

                  of the results together with the relevance to the planning and
                  scheduling community.
