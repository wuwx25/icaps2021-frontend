                  Following the success of the Novel Applications track in
                  previous iterations of the conference, ICAPS 2021 will once
                  again host this track.
                  <br /><br />

                  ICAPS 2021, the 31st International Conference on Automated
                  Planning and Scheduling, will take place in Guangzhou, China.
                  ICAPS 2021 is part of the ICAPS conference series, the premier
                  forum for exchanging news and research results on theory and
                  applications of intelligent planning and scheduling
                  technology.
                  <br /><br />
                  The goal of this special track is to encourage the submission
                  of papers describing all aspects of the development,
                  deployment, and evaluation of planning and scheduling (P&S)
                  systems for real-world problems. Topics addressed in
                  applications papers may include, but are not limited to:
                  <br /><br />
                  * Assessment of impact on end users<br />
                  * Description and modeling of novel application domains<br />
                  * Engineering issues in using planning and scheduling
                  techniques<br />
                  * Evaluation, testing, and validation of planning and
                  scheduling applications<br />
                  * Experiences in development, deployment, and maintenance of
                  planning and scheduling applications<br />
                  * Industry / application challenge problems<br />
                  * Integration of multiple planning and scheduling techniques,
                  or of planning and scheduling techniques with techniques from
                  other areas or disciplines<br />
                  * User interface design, visualization, and explanation for a
                  planning and scheduling application<br />
                  <br />
                  This track will have a separate programme committee (PC)
                  consisting of individuals with experience working on
                  applications of planning and scheduling technology to real
                  world problems. Papers submitted to this track will be
                  evaluated using criteria that differs from the main track;
                  specifically:
                  <br /><br />
                  * Significance of the application problem being addressed<br />
                  * Importance of planning and scheduling technology to solution
                  of the problem<br />
                  * Novelty of the application and technical approach to the
                  application<br />
                  * Evaluation of the system and its deployment<br />
                  * Clarity of the descriptions of the application problem,
                  techniques used, and results<br />
                  * Applicability to real-world problems such as by dataset
                  complexity and actual use in practice<br />
                  <br />

                  <h4>SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS</h4>

                  Authors may submit long papers (8 pages in AAAI style plus up
                  to one page of references) or short papers (4 pages plus up to
                  one page of references). The type of paper must be indicated
                  at submission time. For more information, see
                  <a
                    class="overflow_link"

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  All papers, regardless of length, will be reviewed against the
                  criteria stated above, and are expected to meet the high
                  standards set by ICAPS. Full technical papers are expected to
                  report on a significant application effort, emerging or
                  deployed; while short papers may report on more limited
                  aspects of a particular application, approach, or study.
                  Over-length papers will be rejected without review.

                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Authors making multiple submissions must ensure that each
                  submission has significant unique content. Papers submitted to
                  ICAPS 2021 may not be submitted to other conferences or
                  journals during the ICAPS 2021 review period, nor may they be
                  already under review or published in other conferences or
                  journals. Submissions may appear in non-referred or
                  non-archival venues such as arXiv or a workshop without
                  archival proceedings.
