                  ICAPS 2021 Doctoral Consortium and Mentoring Program will be
                  hosted on June 6, 2021, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou,
                  China (virtual attendance will be supported).
                  <br /><br />
                  <h4>ICAPS Doctoral Consortium</h4>
                  The Doctoral Consortium (DC) is intended to provide Ph.D.
                  students with the opportunity to interact closely with
                  established researchers and to get feedback on their research,
                  provide advice on career possibilities and build a
                  professional network, improving the cohesion of new
                  researchers with the ICAPS community. The DC is open to all
                  doctoral student attendees of the conference and will take
                  place on June 6th (the day before ICAPS workshops and
                  tutorials). Registering for the Doctoral Consortium will be
                  part of the registration process for the conference and all
                  students are invited to take part in it.
                  <br /><br />
                  <h4>Mentoring Program</h4>
                  As part of the Doctoral Consortium, ICAPS will offer a
                  Mentoring Program. The Mentoring Program is designed to
                  provide senior graduate students with an opportunity for
                  in-depth advice by senior members of the field regarding
                  careers and research skills. Each student accepted to the
                  program will be matched with an established researcher in the
                  field who will assist the student with research and career
                  management advice. We encourage current doctoral students
                  (students whose Ph.D. is in progress, but who are at least a
                  year from defence/completion) to apply for the Mentoring
                  Program. Students do not need to be accepted into the
                  Mentoring Program to attend and participate in the Doctoral
                  Consortium.
                  <br /><br />
                  <h4>Application Procedure for the Mentoring Program</h4>
                  To participate in the Mentoring Program, an application is
                  required. Applicants for the Mentoring Program should submit a
                  single PDF file at

                  <h4>Student Support</h4>
                  ICAPS will provide student support partly covering travel
                  and/or registration costs through a separate scholarship
                  application process. Students are not required to apply for
                  the Mentoring Program to be considered for this support.
                  Participation in the DC, however, is a requirement for
                  students receiving travel assistance (as are some light
                  service tasks during the conference). Details about
                  application for student support will be posted soon at
                  <a href="https://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/">
                    https://icaps21.icaps-conference.org/ </a
                  >.
                  <br /><br />
                  <h4>Travel, Venue and Schedule</h4>
                  Given the worldwide travel situation, the schedule, venue and
                  physical/virtual organization for ICAPS 2021 is subject to
                  uncertainty, but ICAPS 2021, and the Doctoral Consortium, will
                  support virtual attendance. Please continue to monitor the
                  ICAPS 2021 conference site for schedule, venue, and travel
                  updates, including for the DC:
