<p>The award committee is requesting nominations of candidate papers. The nomination material should include:</p>

<h4><strong>Call for Nominations: ICAPS 2021 Best Dissertation Award</strong></h4>



<p><strong>Nomination deadline: 15 February 2021 UTC-12</strong></p>



<p>This award honors an outstanding PhD dissertation in any area of automated planning and scheduling. It will be given during the ICAPS 2021 conference. PhD dissertations that were completed and filed in 2019 or 2020 will be considered for the ICAPS 2021 Best Dissertation Award. The recipient will receive a certificate, 500 USD, and one complimentary registration to the ICAPS 2021 conference.</p>



<p>The  award committee is requesting nominations of candidate PhD dissertations. The nomination material should include the following:</p>



<ul><li>a CV of the candidate with a complete list of publications,</li><li>a copy of the dissertation or URL from which the dissertation can be retrieved,</li><li>a nomination letter by the PhD advisor (this letter must specify the completion/filing date of the dissertation), and</li><li>two additional recommendation letters.</li></ul>



<p>Email all nominations, as a ZIP archive of PDF files, to the following address: <a href="mailto:icaps-awards-committee@googlegroups.com">icaps-awards-committee[at]googlegroups*dot*com</a></p>



<p>The  two additional recommendation letters may be sent separately to the above address by the recommenders if desired, or can be included in the ZIP archive.</p>



<p>A  word of caution: it is possible to postpone asking recommenders for their letters until the last minute, leaving them little time to compose and send the letters in to the committee. This seems to us to be a high-risk strategy. We urge nominators to request these letters as soon  as possible, since the recommenders may need to familiarize themselves with the contents of the dissertation. Nominators are responsible for ensuring that the letters of recommendation are submitted by the final deadline. The committee will not solicit missing letters, nor will it  review incomplete nomination packets.</p>



<p>The dissertation should preferably be written in English. However, we accept dissertations not written in English if they are submitted together with the following documents that must be written in English: an extended abstract of the dissertation, a series of papers that cover  the key results of the dissertation and a document that describes the mapping from the papers to the chapters of the dissertation. Students who did not win an award last year can be nominated again if they are still eligible this year.</p>
