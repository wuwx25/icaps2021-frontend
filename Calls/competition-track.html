                  We invite proposals for the International Conference on
                  Automated Planning and Scheduling 2021 (ICAPS 2021)
                  competition track to be held in Guangzhou, China. We solicit
                  competition proposals on any topic of interest to the Planning
                  & Scheduling community. We especially encourage competition
                  proposals from emerging fields or new application domains
                  related to Planning and Scheduling. Interdisciplinary topics
                  that will attract a significant cross-section of the community
                  are especially encouraged.<br /><br />

                  Participants will compete to obtain the best score on a
                  planning task of interest to the ICAPS community based on the
                  problem and data defined and released by the organizers of the
                  competition. Organizers for a certain challenge should define
                  the tasks specifically such that participants can build their
                  planning/scheduling models and/or their learning models based
                  on the task descriptions. Example challenge problems for
                  competitions are (but certainly not limited to):<br /><br />
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      <b>Bicycle sharing:</b> A bicycle-sharing system is a
                      service in which bicycles are made available for shared
                      use to individuals on a short term basis. Many bike share
                      systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" and
                      return it at another dock belonging to the same system. To
                      reduce the loss of user demands on using bicycles in every
                      station, the system needs to make a plan to reschedule
                      bicycles among stations by predicting future use of
                      bicycles in each station. Considering there are many
                      constraints related to actions of repositioning bicycles,
                      solving tasks of repositioning bicycles with
                      (probabilistic) planning or scheduling models is likely to
                      improve the effectiveness and efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Smart dispatching:</b> A smart-dispatching system is to
                      effectively and efficiently dispatch a service, e.g., a
                      driver in DIDI or Uber, to a passenger’s demand. The
                      system needs to consider the current locations of drivers
                      and passengers, the destinations of passengers, and the
                      current status of traffic. In this scenario, planning and
                      scheduling techniques could be adopted to improve the
                      efficiency of dispatching considering the complexity of
                      factors and the large scale of demands and supplies, and
                      exhibit explanations when confronting unexpected issues,
                      such as some clients waiting too long or lots of
                      complaints received.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Auto-driving</b> Auto-driving needs to handle
                      complicated uncertain environments rapidly. Large-scale
                      observations from sensors often makes auto-driving systems
                      difficult to make accurate decisions efficiently.
                      Uncertain/Probabilistic planning and path planning could
                      be helpful for improving auto-driving systems.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Unmanned warehouse:</b> Sorting packages in an unmanned
                      warehouse is a challenging planning task. It needs to
                      consider various packages in the same order and make
                      efficient routes for each order such that each order can
                      be delivered efficiently. It is possible to model the
                      package sorting problem as a planning or scheduling
                      problem and explore planning techniques to improve the
                      effectiveness and efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Chemical synthesis:</b> Synthesizing small organic
                      molecules is a process of planning a series of reactions.
                      It is challenging to synthesize organic molecules of
                      high-quality with respect to some specific features,
                      considering the large scale of reactions and molecules.
                      Automated retrosynthesis or synthesis of molecules has
                      been an open problem for 50 years due to its scientific
                      importance in chemistry as well as its direct applications
                      to pharmaceutical and material industries.
                    </li>

                  <br />
                  There will be a competition track at ICAPS 2021, co-located
                  with the conference workshops, where competition results will
                  be presented and discussed. Competition organizers will be
                  asked to propose a tentative schedule for presentation of the
                  competition and its results during an assigned time slot;
                  ICAPS will provide coffee breaks and, if necessary, poster
                  facilities.

                  <br /><br />
                  For any additional questions please contact the ICAPS
                  competition chairs.

                  <h4>REVIEWING AND SELECTION PROCESS</h4>
                  A competition program committee will be formed, consisting of
                  experts on planning, learning and challenge organization. Each
                  proposal will be reviewed by at least three members of the
                  committee. The factors that will be considered when evaluating
                  proposals include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>Task:</b> Impact, originality, relevance to the ICAPS
                      community will all be considered. Tasks that include
                      humanitarian and/or positive societal impact are
                      especially highly encouraged, although other topics
                      relevant to the ICAPS community will also be considered.
                      If humanitarian projects are submitted, the involvement of
                      the community in question is strongly desired, and
                      <a

                      >
                      is strongly discouraged.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Protocol and Readiness:</b> Feasibility of the task
                      chosen, soundness of the evaluation criteria, and clarity
                      and fairness of the competition rules will be considered.
                      The readiness of the competition in terms of data, code,
                      etc. will also be considered.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>Logistics:</b> Schedule, plan for attracting
                      competition participants, and experience and diversity of
                      the organizers will all be considered. The specific plan
                      for attracting participants of groups under-represented at
                      ICAPS will be considered.

                      Competition organizers should propose a timeline for
                      running the competition to ensure that participants have
                      enough time to contribute high-quality entries. It is
                      recommended that competitions be completed by end of May,
