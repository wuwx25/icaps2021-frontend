The model is able to outline reasonable patrol locations and routes, adapting to changes in the geographical pattern of call locations, and permits optimization of routes accommodating fuel economy and other cost-based concerns into account in a principled way. We also present an actual patrolling system we have developed around this model, and present simulated results comparing its performance vis-a-vis centroid-based patrol location prediction and judgments made by humans.",

        abstract:
          "We demonstrate a system with integrated acting, planning, and learning algorithms that uses hierarchical operational models to perform tasks in dynamically changing environments. In AI research, synthesizing a plan of action has typically used descriptive models of the actions that abstractly specify what might happen as a result of an action and are tailored for efficiently computing state transitions. However, executing the planned actions has needed operational models, in which rich computational control structures and closed-loop online decision-making are used to specify how to perform an action in a nondeterministic execution context, react to events and adapt to an unfolding situation. Deliberative actors, which integrate acting and planning, have typically needed to use both of these models together---which causes problems when attempting to develop the different models, verify their consistency, and smoothly interleave acting and planning. As an alternative, we demonstrate an acting and planning engine in which both planning and acting use the same operational models. These rely on hierarchical task-oriented refinement methods offering rich control structures. In addition, we also have learning strategies that guide the actor and the planner.",

While alternative pathfinding in road networks has received significant attention, to the best of our knowledge, it has not been studied in maps with obstacles such as game maps and indoor venues, e.g., airport, shopping center etc. Furthermore, it is not clear whether the techniques designed for road networks generate high-quality alternative paths for game maps and indoor venues. To this end, we present a web-based demonstration system that visualises the alternative paths in game maps and indoor venues generated by three of the most popular techniques originally designed for the road networks. This system will help evaluating these techniques and identifying potential limitations that must be addressed for better alternative pathfinding in game maps and indoor venues.",

Due to limited resources and energy to perform multiple missions, an efficient tool capable of optimising mission allocations without the need for major re-planning of the missions is required. We improve the performance of centralised mission planner by combining an adaptive problem generator with temporal planning to obtain feasible plans. We create a simulator, a GAZEBO simulated environment unifying heterogeneous autonomous systems for offshore wind farms application, integrate our method, and demonstrate our approach to plan generation for an inspection, maintenance, and repair of an offshore wind turbine.",

However, this information is inaccessible to a lot of people as they are unaware of query languages used for searching through data. In this demonstration, we present PRUDENT - where we harness the power of dialog systems to help the user search for information using natural language. PRUDENT makes use of a planner to adapt to the content structure of the data source and retrieve results, thereby, making the dialog agent generic. However, PDDL based planning needs models and one would want to learn plans over time. Hence, RL based plan generation is also desirable. We show a system which can do this and demonstrate the viability of our approach on large data sets of UNSPSC and ICD-10.",
