                        Gaps in the Foundations of Planning with Approximation
                      </h5>
                      <p class="card-text">
                        Planning consists of imagining courses of action and
                        their consequences, and deciding ahead of time which
                        ones to do. In the standard reinforcement-learning model
                        of an intelligent agent, the component that does the
                        imagining of consequences is called the transition model
                        of the environment, and the deciding in advance is via a
                        change in the agent’s policy. Planning and model
                        learning have been studied for seven decades and yet
                        remain largely unsolved in the face of genuine
                        approximation—models that do not become exact in the
                        high-data limit. In this talk I briefly assess the
                        challenges of extending dynamic-programming-style
                        planning (value iteration) in the five most important
                        ways: function approximation, partial observability,
                        stochastic transitions, average reward, and temporal
                        abstraction (options). My assessment is that these
                        extensions are straightforward until they are combined
                        with genuine approximation in the model, in which case
                        we have barely a clue how to proceed in a scalable way.
                        Nevertheless, we do have a few clues; I suggest the
                        ideas of expectation models, metadata, and
                        representation search as general strategies for learning
                        approximate environment models suitable for use in
                        planning.

                        Richard S. Sutton is a distinguished research scientist
                        at DeepMind Alberta and a professor in the Department of
                        Computing Science at the University of Alberta. Prior to
                        joining DeepMind in 2017 and the University of Alberta
                        in 2003, he worked in industry at AT&amp;T and GTE Labs,
                        and in academia at the University of Massachusetts. He
                        received a PhD in computer science from the University
                        of Massachusetts in 1984 and a BA in psychology from
                        Stanford University in 1978. He is co-author of the
                        textbook Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction from
                        MIT Press. He is also a fellow of the Royal Society, the
                        Royal Society of Canada, the Association for the
                        Advancement of Artificial Intelligence, the Alberta
                        Machine Intelligence Institute (Amii), and CIFAR. His
                        research interests center on the learning problems
                        facing a decision-maker interacting with its
                        environment, which he sees as central to intelligence.
                        He has additional interests in animal learning
                        psychology, in connectionist networks, and generally in
                        systems that continually improve their representations
                        and models of the world. His scientific publications
                        have been cited more than 100,000 times. He is also a
                        libertarian, a chess player, and a cancer survivor.

                      <p class="card-text">
                        Multi-goal task planning has been an optimization
                        question in Operation Research and Logistics for a long
                        time. We will present novel advances for high-speed
                        solving these discrete planning problems. With fast
                        single-source shortest path search, the map is condensed

                        While the discrete multi-goal task planning problem is
                        already hard, the "physical" motion planning problem is
                        even more demanding. The integration of task and motion
                        planning is considered one the most important problems
                        in robotics nowadays. Robots have sizes, heading, and
                        velocity, and their motion can often be described only
                        according to non-linear differential equations. The
                        dynamics of movements, existing obstacles and many
                        waypoints to visit are only some of the challenges to
                        face. In real-world problems, we often have additional
                        constraints like inspecting areas of interest in some
                        certain order, while still minimizing the time for the
                        travel. The trickiest part is to solve the hard
                        combinatorial discrete tasks like the generalized and
                        clustered traveling salesman problems, and - at the same
                        time - providing valid trajectories for the robot. We
                        extend a framework in which a motion tree is steadily
                        grown, and abstractions to discrete planning problems
                        are used as a heuristic guidance for the on-going
                        solution process to eventually visit all waypoints. In
                        case of inspection, we generate the waypoints fully
                        automatically, using a combination of skeletonization
                        methods together with a filtering mechanism based on
                        hitting sets.

                        Robots used for inspection or moving of goods are also
                        often required to visit certain locations subject to
                        time and resource consumption. This requires not only
                        planning collision-free and dynamically feasible
                        motions, but also reasoning about constraints. To
                        effectively solve this open problem, we couple task
                        planning over a discrete abstraction with sampling-based
                        motion planning over the continuous state space of
                        feasible motions. The discrete abstraction is obtained
                        by imposing a roadmap that captures the connectivity of
                        the free space. We increase the expressiveness and
                        scalability of the approach, as we raise the number of
                        goals and the difficulty of satisfying the time and
                        resource constraints. With our technology we are able to
                        efficiently generate and execute long-term missions in
                        real-time. The robot, the environment model, and the
                        planning problem specification can be modified
                        non-intrusively, essential in many application
                        scenarios. Other topics of interest are robot planning
                        with limits in energy consumption.
